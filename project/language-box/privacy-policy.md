Privacy Policy for WixBook: Language Box

Effective Date: February 8, 2026
1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how our language learning application ("the App") collects, uses, and protects your information. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this policy.
2. Information We Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App collects the following types of data:

    Progress Data: We track your "sequenceNumber" and game statistics (skill levels in different languages) 
    to provide a seamless learning experience.

    Local Cache: This data is stored locally on your device using a Cache Service to allow you to resume your progress.

    Usage Information: We may collect non-personal information about how you interact with the games 
    (Sentence Builder, Match Sentence, etc.) to improve our content.

3. Third-Party Services

The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:

    Google AdMob: We display interstitial ads for monetization. AdMob may collect device identifiers and 
    location data to show relevant ads.

    Google Play Services: Used for app functionality and stability.

4. Data Storage and "Clear Cache"

Your progress is stored locally on your device. We provide a "Clear Cache" feature in the settings. By using this feature, you can:

    Completely reset your progress for a specific language and level.

    Delete the stored sequenceNumber from your device, returning your progress to the beginning.

5. Text-to-Speech and Audio

The App uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) and audio features for pronunciation and listening exercises (e.g., Match Sentence, Listen Word). These features process text/audio data locally or via standard system APIs to enhance your learning experience.
6. Children’s Privacy

Our App is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers/local storage.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
