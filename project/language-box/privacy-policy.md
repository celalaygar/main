Privacy Policy for WixBook: Language Box

Effective Date: February 8, 2026
1. No Personal Data Collection

We believe in your privacy. Language Box does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal credentials.
2. Local Progress Tracking (Caching)

To provide a seamless learning experience, the App tracks your progress (e.g., current question number and game statistics) locally on your device:

    How it works: We use a local Cache Service to remember where you left off in each game mode (Sentence Builder, Scrambled Word, etc.).

    Data Location: This data stays on your phone. It is not linked to any personal identity.

    Control: You can use the "Clear Cache" button in the settings at any time to permanently delete this progress data from your device.

3. Statistics

The App displays your skill levels based on your performance in the games. These statistics are generated locally for your own viewing and are not shared with third parties.
4. Third-Party Services & Ads

The App includes third-party advertisements (Google AdMob) to remain free to use. These third-party providers may use cookies or device identifiers to serve ads based on your interests. You can manage these identifiers through your device settings.
5. Data Security

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no risk of your personal identity being compromised through our database. We use secure communication (HTTPS) between the App and our backend server to fetch game content (questions and answers).
